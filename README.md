### What I Learned

Throughout the course, I practiced real SQL queries and explored core concepts including:
- Basic database structures and syntax
- Writing `SELECT` statements to retrieve data
- Using `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY` clauses
- Filtering, sorting, and aggregating data
- Applying arithmetic and logical expressions

### Reflections & Motivation

This course opened my eyes to how **essential and powerful SQL** is in real-world data workflows â€” from basic analytics to business intelligence and backend services. I realized how often SQL is listed as a core skill in data analyst, data engineer, and even web developer roles.

I'm especially drawn to:
- Turning raw data into insights
- Writing clean, optimized queries
- Automating analysis via SQL inside Python (with libraries like DuckDB & Pandas)

I'm genuinely passionate about continuing my path in **data analysis and engineering**, and this course was a solid first step. More to come!
